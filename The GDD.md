# Game Design Document
```ad-important
title: This is an Overview!
This is not a design outline, and in order to get a bit closer to a development strategy reference [[First Sprint|the initial prototype goals]] to help build some goals for the project.
```

## Overview
A humble witch arrives to a cabin hidden from a nearby a town a plant companion. Through the tender of this focus and the garden surrounding it, the witch may grow their powers to better serve the town nearby. The townsfolk, some liking and some hating magic, can be persuaded to buy your wares. As you grow stronger and closer to the town, they reveal more about the world to you, and your relationships forge stronger witches.

## Inspiration
Rune Factory's blend of fantasy and harvest moon lead to the idea of a farming system that was less based on the classic style of grid based farming growth, but instead on a magic system that grew around a simple and free flow farm. The system itself is yet to be seen, but it's mechanics change as altered by other systems:
- Monster Fighting
- Towns folk needs/wants
- The rarity of certain ingredients/plants
- Knowledge of new ways to create magic/spells

Mainly, the way systems interconnect and push the core game loop of farming, selling/gifting the harvest, and farming is taken from the harvest moon style games. The idea being that that core loop is then altered by placing the focus on farming parallel with a witch gaining more and more powers.

- Laid back game loop that harkens back to old farming sims with a focus on magic as the main way to transform productive systems (farming, fishing, monster loot) to payoff (relationships, magic gain, new plant varieties)
- 2D Top Down Isometric art, with a Modern (non-pixel perfect) low res style. Allows for free movement, item placement

## Design Goals
Create some design goals/pillars that every feature is supposed to support
- The player feels a traditional farming sim game style while working towards the goal of magical mastery
- Player relations to npcs alter the game dramatically through the npc's effects on the magic system
- There is a larger feedback loop similar to how idle games allow a player to restart with advantages given by their last playthroughs. A player may 'restart' their playthrough with alterations to the town that encourages exploration of new relationship dynamics


## Game Loop

The witch is expected to have the common day cycle loop
## Important Moments
### Intro and Hook
### Repetive Feedbacks


## Feature Set
### The Cabin
The Cabin that the player (the witch) lives around should be designed foremost. Part of what will make the witch feel like a 'witch' is the way their natural lifestyle creeps into their home. The Cabin serves functional purposes:
- **The Focus Plant** (Thinking of a name, [[Bontictionary|reference vocab]]) should be growing in through the cabin, maybe starting indoors, and spreading into the cabin. Or perhaps starting inside until bursting through the cabin as it gains powers
- **The Bed**! Honestly, beds are such an important thing in these games it's wild how few features they have. Sleep to pass the time at night! But let us not forget how this affects events, plot, rewards, and magic?
- **Saving?** I think that this is the kind of game where you can have autosaves, but you save either just when you sleep or when you actively save, like the journal in RuneFactory
- **Storage:** I would like to replicate the frantic nature of a cluttered witch digging through their shelves, chests, jars, bottles, and hanging racks! So this is the highlight for me. We can get a chest, or perhaps we can program a collections of shelves, racks, bins, baskets, and piles! 
- **Workspace:** I don't know how the player modifies resources, but it should happen *alot* in here, under the goal of tying the player to the emersive experience, rather then simplifying the gameplay
