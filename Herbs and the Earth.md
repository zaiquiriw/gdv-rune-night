# Herbs and the Earth
>"On his own land or on others', he sought the company of rural people. In their husbandry he found the "poignant and poetic recognition of the long continuity of man""

Henry Beston seems to be just an American Naturalist and Environmentalist. Yet, he has a kind of flair for writing about nature from personal experience I want to absorb just a little bit from. That is why I wanna note down some of this guy's wild quotes.

## Introduction Stuff
> To him even the smallest collection contains something "of earth and of time and of magic and of peace." There is basil, "predetermined to symmetry," sage, with its "pebbled leaves silvered over with a summer dew," "the diving mind itself reflected" in the blue blossoms of borage.

This guy seems to just stare at the plants in the garden, using them for inspiration. And they are all mostly Eurasian. Bayberry, Beebalm, and Wintergreen are American, but the rest are all hidden somewhere in Europe and Asia.
