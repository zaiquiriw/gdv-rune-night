# Vault Parity
In order to set up a good documentation system for the [[gdv|game design vault]] (gdv)we will be using [obsidian git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) to automatically commit, push, and pull all of the contents of the vault. However, incase seperate users would like to have seperate plugin folders, or just custom workflows, details of this setup are useful

## Requirements
1. Git is installed
2. The user is logged in
3. The user has a clone of the remote repository

The plugin should have all default settings cloned from the repo.

## Custom Settings
