# Farming Sim: Rune Night
A magical farming simulation, based around a classic Harvest Moon farming loop, with an interactive cast of characters all working around a magic system that connects with the plants you are growing. The idea is, the player is a witch that was driven from their last town and has wondered the country side, learning to hone their magic in the nature around them. They find an abandoned cabin on the country side near a smaller town, and begin starting up again

## Idea Pitching
### The Hook
The Character starts with the discovery of their cabin, and discovers a wonderful garden hidden on the property, surrounded by a bountiful forest with caves, a river, some worked land (plains), and a hunting path into town. The player sleeps for the night after a tutorial teaching them how to care for a plant they kept with them on their travels, a medicinal herb of some sort they were transplanting on their travels. They awake late that night to find a young hunter staggering into to their door. They are badly injured during a hunt turned wrong by a monster attack in the night. You reveal yourself, and begin to heal them with regular methods, but the damage is more than that can fix. (I'm imagining a familiar/creature/voice that is guiding the player).

Giving up on obscuring your magical nature from witch hunters, you use your powers (a symbolic magical system that is very visual with somatic and material components) with your plant as an ingredient to heal their wounds. Only, they were concious the whole time, and to your surprise are enraptured by your art.

I want this intro to be loopable, so if the player fails to present themselves as a good witch to their town, they may restart a playthrough with some aspects carry over from the last playthrough. Meaning, the initial incident must always be the witch helping some townsfolk.
- The player could have characters that have been to many towns, and some of the skills they have wrap over while the game itself actually has a lot of progress in the town itself
- This would make it to where making one set of memorable townsfolk would be difficult for each town. Instead there must be a mechanic to explain it... ...
- What if the witch is being guided by some external force, that keeps jumbling the timeline and randomizing the town (with hinting that the witch doing so is another-witch/yourself that has fully mastered your powers and is helping a young witch)

### Goals?
The opening incident leads the witch to interact with the town, with few characters motivating the Witch to openly use their powers, most of them being raised to hate witches, and some truly hating them. The player must slowly grow their garden, their powers, and other systems to convince the townsfolk they have a postive influence on the town. The plot could follow some goals:
- Controlling the local monster population, whether that be through sparing/taming or killing it
- Peacefully or violently fighting off witch hunter (guild?) in the town
- Forcing the worst witch haters to either be comfortable with you in some major events or force them from the town.

I would also want to introduce some sort of time/randomizer mechanic that is some form of magic plant, that through its randomizations ties to the player's origins, their looping through an external powerful witch, and other core systems that effec the way the player plays the story.

### Formatting
I think the game would have to be 2D, unless I feel like getting good at low poly top down assets like ThinMatrix. And I think pixel art would make it a bit easier to tie assets together. With that in mind, I think an initial mock up of the game would be just the witch in the cabin, managing their plants on their own without the towns external motivation, just to test out and code mechanics.
