# Vault Notes
This repository/vault is where I will store all notes relating to the design of the currently dubbed "Rune Night" Game.

## Usage With Github
I do not intend to have this vault automatically sync with github, instead purposeful commits should be made when changes or ideas are documented. In order to encourage active communication [[Live Notes|some system]] should be used like google docs. For the time being, a simple markdown repo (that can be easily ported to the larger game repo) will be functional

## Settings Parity
While an obsidian vault may be used by multiple users, it would be useful if some users could have custom rules to affect the function or appearance of the vault. I believe some plugins can help with this. The issue being:
- Problem: Users may want to change notes inside of the .obsidian folder to edit vault settings
- Problem: Making all of the contents of that folder ignored by github would ruin vault setting parity while allowing notes to be uploaded
- Goal: Users could change specific parts of the vault settings that could be ignored by git, but not ignore key plugin updates or changes

Any solution to this problem could be stored [[Vault Parity|here]].

## Plugin Notes
A list of plugins used in this vault will help maintain a full understanding of what is available to editors
- Advanced Tables (Duh)
- Style Settings: Allows editing of vaults beyond css snippets
- Primary (Theme): I like the colors
- Admonition: For advanced callouts
- Paste URL into Selection:  A must have, allows you to highlight text then press ctrl+v to create a hyper link in that text.
- Excalidraw: I want to learn how to use this for better note taking. One day!
