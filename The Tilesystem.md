# A Tiling Perspective
The description of:
- The angle the camera is viewing the art
- What type of objects exist when considering 2D sprites vs hi res sprites rendered at 3D
- How an object in the game world interacts with some hidden coordinate system:
	- Fully Free Flow Grid?
	- Small sub grid where items are larger then the grid at placed above it
	- Most items are one size?
	- Design in such a way where placement in the world is arbitrary (Like a potted garden, or predefined growing spaces)
- How the player moves through that world (Continuous velocity in a 2D plane)
- How are background objects that need not be objects rendered, computed, stored, and interacted with
- Blah blah blah I'm small brain now
